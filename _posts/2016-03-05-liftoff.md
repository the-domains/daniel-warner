I'm going to do it. I'm going to start a blog, or at least something like a blog. I want to create create a place where I can post things, all sorts of things, and share them with the world. Why? Because hopefully it will force me to actually start creating things again. 

I'd like to think that I was creative growing up. I've always liked art and design but I was never that great at it. Still, that never stopped me from being interested in it and diving into different aspects of it throughout my life. I went through periods of time where I really got into photography, film making, graphic design, and now, web design & development.

I'm still a fan of all of these things, and I enjoy them as a passive audience member, but I myself haven't created anything in any of these mediums in quite some time. Now, I am employed as a web developer and that's what I do all day, every day as my job, and I love my job, but I haven't made anything for fun outside of work, well, since I started my job.

I'm hoping that by starting a place like this it will encourage me to start  creating things for fun again. I'd really like to start taking photos, designing logos, writing posts, and building web apps, and hopefully this will give me the motivation to do it.
