I'm going to do 
it. I'm going to start a blog, or at least something like a blog. I want
to create a place where I can post things, all sorts of things, 
and share them with the world. Why? Because hopefully it will force me 
to actually start creating things again. 

I'd
like to think that I was creative growing up. I've always liked art and
design but I was never that great at it. Still, that never stopped me 
from being interested in it and diving into different aspects of it 
throughout my life. I went through periods of time where I really got 
into photography, film making, graphic design, and now, web design &
development.

I'm
still a fan of these things, and I enjoy them as a passive 
audience member, but I haven't created anything in any of these 
mediums in some time. I am a web developer and 
that's what I do all day, every day as my job, and I love my job, but I 
haven't made anything for fun outside of work, well, since I started my 
job.

I'm 
hoping that by starting a place like this it will encourage me to start 
creating things for fun again. I'd really like to start taking photos, 
designing logos, writing posts, and building web apps, and hopefully 
this will give me the motivation to do it.
